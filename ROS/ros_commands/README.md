### Additional techniques if you find yourself still stuck:
1. ASK FOR HELP!!!

2. Try `<command> --help` or `<command> -h`

   * These two commands typically are useful if you do not know a flag or don't know a command

3. Go onto ros.org and search for your specific command. Most commands are explained in a thorough and straight forward way.

If you learn additional commands, please insert them into the table at the bottom of the specified README.md.
