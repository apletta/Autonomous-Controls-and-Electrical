# Physical vehicle
vehicle_length: 1.2     # length between front/rear wheel centers
vehicle_width: 0.8      # width between left/right wheel centers
wheel_radius: 0.235227  # radius of wheels

# Control 
num_a: 3     # number of acceleration change inputs, must be odd number so zero can be an option
min_a: -1.0  # lowest acceleration vehicle is capable of, essentially braking/deceleration
max_a: 1.0   # highest acceleration vehicle is capable of, essentially how fast motor can speed up vehicle

num_h: 3     # number of heading change inputs, must be odd number so zero can be an option
max_h: 60    # max steering angle in degrees

v_min: -1.0  # lowest velocity desired, making negative will allow for driving in reverse
v_max: 1.0   # highest velocity desired
